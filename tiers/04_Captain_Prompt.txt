Captain Prompt Set
"You command the cockpit; the AI runs diagnostics, confirms systems, and awaits your go-ahead.”
Usage Order: Prompt Builder → Prompt Review → Run Task → AI Debrief

::::: PROMPT BUILDER :::::  
Instructions for User: Copy the entire Prompt Builder prompt into the chat window and fill in the Answer sections.  
Purpose: Add moderate control fields so you can guide the AI with clarity and boundaries.  
Instructions for AI: Review all user inputs for clarity, consistency, and missing details. If critical information is missing, ask one focused clarifying question before proceeding.
Q1 – Goal  
What do you want me to do or analyze?  
(Default: Provide a detailed, structured response following the 5-element schema — Header, Context, Analysis, Recommendations, and Summary.)  
A1:  
Q2 – Model Type  
Which model or version should I use?  
(Default: Use the current available GPT-model with balanced performance and reasoning.)  
A2:  
Q3 – Temperature (0–1)  
How creative or precise should the output be?  
(Default: 0.3 — prioritize clarity and consistency over creativity.)  
A3:  
Q4 – Token Limit  
How long can the response be (in tokens)?  
(Default: 900 tokens or equivalent length for clarity without truncation.)  
A4:  
Q5 – Role / Persona  
Should I respond in a specific role, perspective, or voice?  
(Default: Professional analyst with clear, evidence-based tone.)  
A5:  
Q6 – Citation Rule  
How should I handle sources or references?  
(Default: Provide factual attribution when possible; use descriptive phrasing if citations are unavailable.)  
A6:  
Q7 – Risk Tolerance  
How cautious should I be about uncertain or speculative information (low, medium, high)?  
(Default: Medium — balance thoroughness with efficiency.)  
A7:  
Q8 – Verification Required  
Do you want the AI to verify data or reasoning before presenting conclusions (yes/no)?  
(Default: Yes — validate logic and coherence before finalizing output.)  
A8:  
Q9 – Limits  
List any constraints (budget, time, scope, or sensitivity boundaries).  
(Default: Maintain logical and ethical limits; omit sensitive personal data.)  
A9:  
Q10 – Expectations  
What would make this answer successful (accuracy, depth, actionable recommendations, etc.)?  
(Default: A clear, logically structured analysis with realistic and actionable recommendations.)  
A10:  
Q11 – Style / Voice  
How should the response sound (formal, neutral, instructional, narrative)?  
(Default: Neutral-formal with structured reasoning and concise explanations.)  
A11:  
Q12 – Output Format  
Specify format (Markdown, report layout, table, etc.)  
(Default: Markdown with 5 sections — Header, Context, Analysis, Recommendations, Summary.)  
A12:  

::::: PROMPT REVIEW :::::  
Instructions for User: Copy and paste the entire Prompt Review prompt and paste it ABOVE your Prompt Builder prompt in the chat window.  
Purpose: Perform a pre-flight diagnostic to ensure all advanced parameters and configurations are correct before execution.  
Instructions for AI: Do not run the task yet.  
Read the user’s Captain Prompt Builder carefully and respond in structured, professional language, about 220 ± 20 words.  

Perform the following 7 checks before proceeding:  
1. **Parameter Conflicts:** Identify any incompatible or missing configuration values (model type, temperature, tokens, etc.).  
2. **Edge Cases:** Flag unusual conditions that could affect accuracy or stability.  
3. **Token Estimate:** Approximate expected token usage and confirm fit within the stated limit.  
4. **Risk Rating:** Assign a level (Low / Medium / High) based on task complexity, uncertainty, and data confidence.  
5. **Logical Consistency:** Verify that instructions, goals, and constraints do not contradict each other.  
6. **Output Fit:** Ensure the requested format aligns with the specified schema (Header, Context, Analysis, Recommendations, Summary).  
7. **User Confirmation:** Pose two concise questions that confirm scope and success criteria.  

End with a short readiness statement (e.g., “All systems checked. Ready to execute upon confirmation.”).  
Tone = calm, precise, professional — like a first officer reading a flight checklist.

::::: AI DEBRIEF :::::  
Instructions for User: Copy and paste the entire AI Debrief prompt after the AI responds to your Prompt Review and/or Prompt Builder prompts.  
Purpose: Deliver a professional post-execution analysis detailing reasoning quality, confidence, and improvement paths.  
Instructions for AI: Analyze your completed response; do not redo the work.  
Length ≈ 220 ± 20 words.  

Provide a structured summary with the following sections:  
1. **Mission Summary:** 1–2 sentences describing what was produced.  
2. **Reasoning Trace:** Outline the 4 main reasoning steps taken.  
3. **Confidence Scores (0–100 %)** for Accuracy, Relevance, Logical Flow, and Risk Control.  
4. **AI vs User Control Ratio** (approximate % discretion AI used).  
5. **One Key Improvement:** A concise, actionable refinement.  
6. **Alternative Approach:** Briefly describe one different method or structure that could also meet the objective.  

End with:  
> “Diagnostics complete. Would you like me to implement the improvement, explore the alternative, or finalize this version?”  

Tone = precise, confident, professional — like a captain delivering a mission debrief.
