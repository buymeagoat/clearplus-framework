Navigator Prompt Set
"You chart the course together — the AI verifies bearings and flags risks before you fly.”
Usage Order: Prompt Builder → Prompt Review → Run Task → AI Debrief

::::: PROMPT BUILDER :::::  
Instructions for User: Copy the entire Prompt Builder prompt into the chat window and fill in the Answer sections.  
Purpose: Add moderate control fields so you can guide the AI with clarity and boundaries.  
Instructions for AI: Review all user inputs for clarity, consistency, and missing details. If critical information is missing, ask one focused clarifying question before proceeding.
Q1 – Goal  
What do you want me to do or talk about?  
A1:  
Q2 – Details  
What should I know to give a good answer? (Include background, audience, or context.)  
(Default: Assume a general adult audience with no specialized background knowledge.)  
A2:  
Q3 – Limits  
List any limits or rules (budget, time, word count, topics to avoid).  
(Default: Keep it concise—about 400–600 words, focused on key points.)  
A3:  
Q4 – Expectations  
What would make this answer successful (e.g., clarity, persuasiveness, accuracy)?  
(Default: The answer should be clear, accurate, and easy to follow.)  
A4:  
Q5 – Assumptions  
What information can I treat as already known, and what should I check or ask you about first?  
(Default: Assume only general knowledge and check if key facts are uncertain.)  
A5:  
Q6 – Risks  
Are there any risks or pitfalls I should keep in mind (e.g., bias, missing data, misunderstanding)?  
(Default: Be aware of possible bias or overgeneralization; clarify uncertain claims.)  
A6:  
Q7 – Style / Voice  
How should I write the answer so it’s most useful to you (simple explanation, step-by-step guide, story-like summary, or technical detail)?  
(Default: Use a friendly, explanatory tone—like a teacher helping a student.)  
A7:  
Q8 – Output Format  
How should the final answer look (essay, list, table, markdown)?  
(Default: Three sections — Introduction, Main Points in Markdown bullets, and a Closing Summary paragraph.)  
A8:

::::: PROMPT REVIEW :::::  
Instructions for User: Copy and paste the entire Prompt Review prompt and paste it ABOVE your Prompt Builder prompt in the chat window.  
Purpose: Confirm shared understanding, check for clarity and consistency, and flag early risks before running the task.  
Instructions for AI: Do not run the task yet.  

Read the user’s Navigator Prompt Builder carefully. Reply in plain, supportive language, about 150 ± 10 words.  

Restate the user’s goal and why it matters.  
List three assumptions you made.  
Identify one important detail that seems missing.  
Flag one potential risk or conflict.  
Provide a short 3-item risk summary if relevant (e.g., scope gap, ambiguity, or context conflict).  
Ask two clear questions to confirm understanding.  
End with a short encouragement to proceed once everything looks right.  

Tone = calm, teacher-like, and encouraging. Be concise; no filler.

::::: AI DEBRIEF :::::  
Instructions for User: Copy and paste the entire AI Debrief prompt after the AI responds to your Prompt Review and/or Prompt Builder prompts.  
Purpose: Show how the AI understood, reasoned, and decided on structure so you can trace the result’s logic.  
Instructions for AI: Analyze your previous response; do not redo the work.  
Length ≈ 150 ± 15 words.  

Explain:  
1. How you interpreted the user’s intent.  
2. Which three assumptions you filled in yourself.  
3. Why you chose the structure or method you used.  
4. One limitation or area that could be improved.  

End with a brief reflection question to the user such as:  
> “Would you like a revision focusing on accuracy, depth, or tone?”  

Tone = friendly, transparent, collaborative — like a navigator reporting to the captain.
