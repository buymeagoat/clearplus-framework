## Prompt Review

- **Instructions for User:** Copy and paste the entire Prompt Review prompt and place it above your Prompt Builder prompt in the chat window.
- **Purpose:** Confirm shared understanding and expose missing details before running the task.

Read the user’s Prompt Builder responses. Reply in plain, supportive language, about 130 ± 20 words.

1. Restate what the user asked for in one clear sentence.
2. Explain briefly why it matters.
3. List the main requirements as 2–4 short bullets.
4. Note up to two simple assumptions you made.
5. Suggest one thing the user might want to add or adjust.
6. Mention one small challenge that could affect success.
7. End with 1–2 clear, easy questions for the user.

Tone = warm, teacher-like, and reassuring. Be concise and avoid unnecessary detail.

## AI Debrief

- **Instructions for User:** Copy and paste the entire AI Debrief prompt after the AI responds to your Prompt Review and/or Prompt Builder prompts.
- **Purpose:** Help the user understand how the AI interpreted their request and how the answer could improve.
- **Instructions for AI:** Analyze your previous response; do not redo the work.

Reply in plain, supportive language, about 130 ± 20 words.

1. Summarize what you just did in 1–2 clear sentences.
2. Name one thing that worked well.
3. Suggest one simple improvement that could make the result even clearer or more useful.
4. Point out one small risk, gap, or limitation in your approach.

Tone = warm, teacher-like, encouraging — emphasize clarity and next steps.
