title: "Prompt Tiers"
---

This directory contains the five-tier prompt templates ranging from rapid to comprehensive engagement levels. Choose the tier that matches the amount of guidance and control you want when collaborating with the AI.

| Tier | Summary | Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-Pilot | "You give the destination, and the AI flies the route for you." | [Prompt Builder](01_Auto-Pilot_Prompt.md) |
| Co-Pilot | "You set the flight plan; the AI handles the controls, checking with you before takeoff." | [Full prompt sequence](02_Co-Pilot_Prompt.md) |
| Navigator | "You chart the course together — the AI verifies bearings and flags risks before you fly." | [Full prompt sequence](03_Navigator_Prompt.md) |
| Captain | "You command the cockpit; the AI runs diagnostics, confirms systems, and awaits your go-ahead." | [Full prompt sequence](04_Captain_Prompt.md) |
| Manual Control | "You fly entirely by hand — the AI follows your exact instructions, no autopilot engaged." | [Full prompt sequence](05_Manual_Control_Prompt.md) |

Each Markdown file includes the Prompt Builder along with review and debrief steps tailored to that tier.
