# CLEAR+ Framework

**Advancing Human–AI Collaboration through Structured Reflection**

---

## Overview

The **CLEAR+ Framework** helps users of all levels transform AI use from quick one‑off questions into reflective, transparent collaboration. Built upon the Australian Catholic University’s original **CLEAR** model (Context, Limits, Expectations, Assumptions, Risks), CLEAR+ adds two meta‑cognitive mechanisms:

* **Prompt Review** – the AI restates, verifies, and checks assumptions *before* running a task.
* **AI Debrief** – the AI explains how it interpreted the user’s instructions *after* the task.

Together, these create a feedback loop that improves clarity, reduces hallucinations, and teaches users how to prompt more effectively across all large language models.

## Flight Modes (Prompt Sets)

CLEAR+ includes five escalating prompt sets—each balancing user effort and AI autonomy.

| Mode               | Description                                                                     | Best For                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto‑Pilot**     | Minimal setup. The AI takes most control and acts fast.                         | Quick questions, summaries, and everyday use.   |
| **Co‑Pilot**       | Adds a short pre‑check and post‑task reflection.                                | Email drafting, writing help, idea generation.  |
| **Navigator**      | Introduces context, limits, expectations, and risk checks.                      | Analytical or educational work.                 |
| **Captain**        | Lets advanced users set AI parameters (model, temperature, token limits, etc.). | Technical, research, and policy analysis.       |
| **Manual Control** | Full user command and diagnostic transparency.                                  | Auditing, testing, or advanced experimentation. |

Each mode uses the same three components:

1. **Prompt Builder** – You fill in guided questions.
2. **Prompt Review** – The AI confirms it understands you.
3. **AI Debrief** – The AI reflects on what it did and why.

## How to Use

1. **Copy a Prompt Set** from this repository (Auto‑Pilot through Manual Control).
2. **Paste it into any AI chat interface.**
3. **Fill in the blanks** in the Prompt Builder section.
4. **Run the Prompt Review** step before executing the task.
5. **Read the AI Debrief** afterward to see what the AI assumed and how it reasoned.
6. **Iterate** by refining your inputs and moving up a Flight Mode when you want more control.

You can use CLEAR+ with any model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and any interface that allows text prompting.

## Benefits

* **Reduces ambiguity** and clarifies user intent before execution.
* **Exposes AI reasoning** so users understand what’s happening behind the scenes.
* **Improves trust** by making the AI’s logic visible and reviewable.
* **Teaches prompt literacy** through repetition and reflection.
* **Portable design:** copy‑and‑paste templates work in any LLM chat window.
